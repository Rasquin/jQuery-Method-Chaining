Here is the solution to the challenges given by the school.


CHALLENGE I

Make changes to the script.js file for the jQuery code. Apply the following 
behavior to the blue button in the button.html file:

Create a CSS class (makeRed, add it to style.css) which gives the Button a red
color, apply this class to the button Element (add to class attribute in the html).
Create another class (makeBorder, add it to style.css) which gives the Button a
border of 2px, do not apply to the HTML.
On mouseenter remove the red class and add the border class.
On mouseleave reverse the above.
Use method chaining to achieve the above.


CHALLENGE II
When the button is clicked, make the paragraph slide up. When clicked again,
make it slide down. This effect is a real-world example of how jQuery can be
used on a button or a menu item.

CHALLENGE III
Now try hide() / show() and fadeIn() / fadeOut() on button click. Create a 
second button and paragraph. Run the code and click on the buttons.
